The Margaritaville Casino in downtown Fort Worth, Texas is under scrutiny after several employees have been accused of cheating. The casino has hired security experts to investigate the allegations and they are confident that they will find the truth.

In a statement, the casino said: "Margaritaville Casino takes any allegation of cheating very seriously. We are fully committed to investigating these claims and taking appropriate action. We have hired security experts to assist us in this process and we are confident that we will find the truth."

#  Margaritaville Casino owner denies cheating allegations 

The Margaritaville Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, is facing allegations of cheating after a video of what appears to be casino staff manipulating a game surfaced online. 

In the video, which was uploaded to YouTube on April 14th, casino staff can be seen stacking the deck of cards in favour of one player at a blackjack table. The player then proceeds to win several hands in a row, raising suspicion among other gamblers at the table. 

When approached by local news channel WLOX about the video, casino owner Jimmy Buffett denied all allegations of cheating, stating that the casino employs “tens of thousands of honest people.” He added that “the vast majority of our guests have an enjoyable experience and we work hard every day to protect their trust.” 

WLOX also reached out to the Mississippi Gaming Commission for comment, but they declined to comment until they had completed their own investigation into the matter. 

This is not the first time that Margaritaville Casino has been accused of cheating; in 2016, two players filed a lawsuit against the casino alleging that staff had improperly switched cards during a blackjack game. That case is still pending.

According to local media, a number of players have come forward with allegations that they were short-changed on their winnings at the casino. One player, who asked not to be identified, said that she had won $4,000 on a penny slot machine but was only given $2,000 when she went to cash out.

“I know I didn’t lose $2,000 on that machine in 30 minutes,” she told reporters.

In a statement released on Wednesday, the Margaritaville Casino said that it was “working diligently” to investigate the allegations and would be refunding money to any players who may have been cheated out of their winnings.

The Margaritaville Casino is one of two casinos owned by Landry Entertainment in Biloxi. In a separate statement issued to local media, a spokesperson for Landry Entertainment said that the company was “committed to providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for all of our guests.”

This is not the first time that the Margaritaville Casino has been embroiled in cheating allegations. In 2014, three employees were accused of cheating customers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

#  Margaritaville Casino Cheat Sheet: How to win at Texas Hold'em

Looking to up your game at the Margaritaville casino? Here's a cheat sheet on how to win at Texas Hold'em, courtesy of our experts.

***

1. Start by picking the right table. The table should have an appropriate number of players - not too crowded, and not too sparse. You'll also want to be seated at the front of the table so you can see everyone's cards.

2. Play tight in the early rounds. Don't try to bluff or make big bets - just wait for good hands and let the other players make mistakes.

3. In the later rounds, start betting aggressively. If you have a strong hand, go all-in and try to take down the pot.

4. Be aware of your opponents' betting patterns. If someone always bets high after getting a good hand, they're probably trying to bluff you.

5. Use math to your advantage. Figure out what percentage of hands you need to make in order to win, and adjust your playing strategy accordingly.
