#  Nevada, New Jersey Allow Gambling at 18

Nevada and New Jersey became the first states in the US to allow gambling at 18.

This comes as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling on the case - Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) - which struck down a federal law that barred states from legalizing sports betting.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, stating that the law - the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) - violated states' rights to make their own laws.

The ruling has paved the way for other states to legalize sports betting, and it is expected that many will do so in order to generate revenue.

Gambling companies have welcomed the news, with William Hill Plc saying that it plans to expand its operations in Nevada and New Jersey.

#  Utah and Alabama among States that Don't Allow Gambling at 18

Utah and Alabama are two of the States in the US that don't allow gambling until players reach 21 years of age. Louisiana is among the other States with the same gambling age.

Utah, Alabama, and Louisiana all share something else in common: They are among the poorest States in the nation. Louisiana ranks first in poverty and Utah ranks fifth, while Alabama ranks tenth.

One reason for these States' high poverty rates may be their gambling age restrictions. Gambling provides a much-needed financial boost to state coffers, raising millions – or even billions – of dollars each year. But by restricting gambling to those aged 21 and older, these states are losing out on a major source of revenue.

This is particularly true in Utah and Alabama, which have large populations of young people. According to the 2016 Census Bureau, 30% of Utah's population is under 18 years old, while 27% of Alabama's population is young people. If both states allowed gambling at 18, they could raise millions additional dollars annually from these residents.

There are also social costs associated with delaying gambling until 21. Young people often turn to illegal forms of gambling, such as black market casinos or betting on sports games, when they can't gamble legally. This can lead to crime and addiction problems.

 By allowing gambling at 18, Utah and Alabama could help reduce poverty rates and provide more funding for important social programs. They would also be providing a safe and legal alternative to illegal forms of gambling that can be harmful to young people.

#  Oregon Considering Lowering Legal Gambling Age to 18

Oregon’s Legislative Assembly is currently considering a bill that would lower the legal gambling age from 21 to 18. The proposed bill, Oregon House Bill no. 2178, was introduced by Rep. Carl Wilson (R-Grants Pass) in February and has been gaining traction among lawmakers in the state.

If passed, HB 2178 would allow people as young as 18 years old to legally gamble in Oregon’s casinos, tribal casinos and on the state’s lottery. It would also legalize sports betting and online gambling in the state.

Oregon is one of just a handful of states that has a legal gambling age of 21. The majority of states have a legal gambling age of 18 or 19 years old.

Supporters of the bill say that it will help create jobs and increase revenue for the state. They argue that young adults are already gambling illegally, so it makes sense to regulate and tax the industry.

Critics of the bill argue that gambling can be addictive and harmful to young people. They say that casino and lottery operators are more likely to prey on minors if the legal gambling age is lowered.

The fate of Oregon House Bill no. 2178 remains uncertain, but the debate over whether to lower the legal gambling age is sure to continue.

#  Chief Wants Michigan to Join At-Home Gaming Revolution

In the early days of video gaming, players would gather at each other’s homes to play games like Super Mario Bros. or Sonic the Hedgehog on their televisions. That soon changed with the rise of online gaming and gamers being able to play with people from all over the world.

Now, one Michigan police chief is pushing for a return to those home-gathering days, as he believes they could help fight crime.

Flint Police Chief Tim Johnson said in a recent interview that at-home gaming can provide a “sense of community” that is often missing from an individual’s life. He added that such gatherings can also help teach children about conflict resolution and etiquette.

Johnson’s comments come as the popularity of esports – competitive video gaming – continues to grow. According to market research firm NewZoo, the global esports audience will reach 380 million this year, with revenues approaching $1 billion. In the United States, 137 million people will watch or participate in esports in some way this year.

Michigan is already seeing some of this growth, with Grand Rapids hosting the first-ever state high school championships for League of Legends – one of the most popular esports games – earlier this year. The event drew nearly 2,000 spectators and more than 100 teams from across the state.

While many parents may be hesitant to allow their children to spend hours in front of a screen, Johnson believes that gaming can actually be good for them.

“I think that there’s a lot of good that comes out of video gaming, if it’s used in an appropriate way,” he said. “It can teach kids how to win and lose graciously; it can teach them how to work together as a team; it can teach them strategy.”

#  Some States Consider Allowing Gambling at Age 18, but Most Keep the Current Law

In the United States, each state decides its own minimum gambling age. Most states have set the minimum age at 21, but some states are considering allowing gambling at 18.

The primary argument for lowering the minimum gambling age is that individuals who are legally allowed to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes should also be able to gamble. The opponents of this argument say that gambling can be more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes and that young people are not ready to handle the potential risks associated with gambling.

Some studies have shown that people under the age of 21 are more likely to develop a problem with gambling than adults over the age of 21. However, other studies have shown that there is no significant difference in the rates of addiction between young people and adults.

There is evidence that reducing the minimum gambling age can lead to increased revenue for casinos and state governments. However, there is also evidence that young people who gamble are more likely to experience financial problems than adults.

Ultimately, each state decides its own minimum gambling age. While some states are considering lowering the minimum age to 18, most states have set the minimum age at 21.
