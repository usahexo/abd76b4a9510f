#  What is the purpose of debit?

Debit is a type of card that allows you to spend money that you already have in your account. This is different from a credit card, which allows you to borrow money from a lender and pay it back over time.

With debit, the money is transferred immediately from your account to the merchant’s account. This means that you can only spend as much money as you have in your account. Credit cards, on the other hand, allow you to borrow money and pay it back over time.

Debit cards are popular because they are safer than carrying cash and they can help you stay organized by tracking your spending. They can also be used to withdraw cash from an ATM.
