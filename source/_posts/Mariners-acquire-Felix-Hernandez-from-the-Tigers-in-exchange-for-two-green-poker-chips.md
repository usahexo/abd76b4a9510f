#  Mariners acquire Felix Hernandez from the Tigers in exchange for two green poker chips

In a move that shocked the baseball world, the Mariners acquired Felix Hernandez from the Tigers in exchange for two green poker chips.

"This is an amazing deal for the Mariners," said GM Jerry Dipoto. "We're getting one of the best pitchers in baseball for just two green poker chips. We're going to be a real contender in the AL West this year."

Hernandez, who is entering his age-30 season, has a career record of 148-98 and a 3.53 ERA. He is a six-time All-Star and has won three Cy Young Awards.

"I'm excited to be joining the Mariners," Hernandez said. "I think we can do some big things this year."

The Tigers, who are in rebuilding mode, were looking to acquire young talent and decided to trade Hernandez for two green poker chips.

"We're very happy with this deal," said Tigers GM Al Avila. "We got a great pitcher in return for just two green poker chips."

#  Rangers and Astros bury the hatchet, agree to share the green poker chip value

Houston, TX - 

In a move that celebrates the camaraderie of baseball and good-natured ribbing between division rivals, the Rangers and Astros have announced an agreement to evenly split the value of the green poker chip. The chip, which has been a source of contention between the two clubs since it was first introduced by then-Rangers manager Ron Washington in 2009, was originally worth $100 but has since accrued (inflation) to a value of over $1,000.

"It's always been our hope that we could come to an agreement with the Astros on this matter," said Rangers GM Jon Daniels. "There's no question that the chip is more valuable to us, but we're happy to share in its history and tradition with our friends in Houston."

"It's a great thing for both clubs," added Astros GM Jeff Luhnow. "We're really proud of the chip and how it's come to represent our rivalry. Now we can all enjoy it together."

The announcement marks a resolution to one of the longest-running disputes in MLB history and provides closure for fans on both sides of the Lone Star State.

#  A's fire manager Bob Melvin, citing his inability to win with a green poker chip

The A's announced today that they have fired manager Bob Melvin, citing his inability to win with a green poker chip.

"We gave it our best shot," said team owner John Fisher. "But we just can't seem to win with a green poker chip. We need to go in a different direction."

Fisher would not say who the team is targeting as their new manager, but rumors are swirling that they may be interested in former Yankees manager Joe Girardi.

"Joe is a proven winner, and we believe he could lead our team to a World Series championship," said Fisher. "He's at the top of our list, and we're hoping to make a decision soon."

Girardi, who was fired by the Yankees after the 2017 season, has not yet commented on the A's offer.

#  Mariners sign free agent Yusei Kikuchi to a six-year, $126 million contract

The Seattle Mariners have agreed to a six-year, $126 million contract with free agent left-handed pitcher Yusei Kikuchi, according to multiple reports.

Kikuchi, 27, spent last season with the Seibu Lions in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball League, where he went 14-6 with a 3.08 ERA and 191 strikeouts in 170 innings. He was reportedly pursued by more than 10 teams this offseason.

"We are excited to welcome Yusei to Seattle," Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement. "His abilities on the mound match up well with our players and coaching staff and we believe his style of play will fit well in Safeco Field. We look forward to him joining our organization and helping us compete for championships."

The Mariners will forfeit their second-highest draft pick this year as compensation for signing Kikuchi, whose signing is still pending a physical exam.

Kikuchi represents the latest high-profile addition to the Mariners' roster this offseason, following the signings of Japanese shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima and catcher Robinson Cano.

#  Angels release Mike Trout, stating that they can no longer afford him

The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim released superstar outfielder Mike Trout today, citing their inability to afford his $432 million contract demands.

"It's with a heavy heart that we must say goodbye to Mike," said team owner Arte Moreno. "He has been an incredible player and ambassador for the Angels, but unfortunately we just can't afford him anymore."

The news comes as a shock to baseball fans around the world, as Trout is widely considered the best player in the game. He has won six Silver Slugger awards, four MVPs, and two World Series championships in his ten-year career with the Angels.

"I'm sad to see Mike go, but I wish him all the best in his next chapter," said Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw. "He's going to be missed in Angel Stadium, that's for sure."

Trout is expected to sign with one of the many teams who have expressed interest in him, including the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, and Chicago Cubs.
