The Cotai Strip in Macau is a sight to behold. Towering hotels and casinos line the street, each trying to outdo the other with their glitzy designs and oversized signage. Not far from the action is The Venetian, one of the largest and most luxurious casinos in the world.

The Venetian is home to one of the world's biggest poker rooms, and it's here that I was introduced to Texas hold'em. I'd played poker before, but this was something else altogether. The hundred or so players at the table were all throwing chips around and making deals, while the dealer called out the betting rounds and flashed her cards.

I quickly realized that I was way out of my depth, but fortunately there was a cheat sheet to help me out. This consisted of a laminated card that showed all of the possible hands, together with their ranking from highest to lowest. With this guide in hand, I was able to make some respectable bids and eventually walk away with my pockets a little heavier.

If you're new to Texas hold'em or just want to sharpen your skills, then a cheat sheet can be a valuable asset. Not only will it help you understand the game better, but it will also give you confidence when sitting down at a table. And as they say, knowledge is power!
