#  Study Shows How Many Hands and Fingers of Blackjack Macau Can Play in an Hour

According to a new study released by the University of Southampton, a person can play Blackjack Macau at a rate of up to 12 hands per hour. This is the first study to look at how many fingers people use when playing the popular casino game.

The researchers recruited 20 volunteers and asked them to play Blackjack Macau for one hour. They used motion-tracking devices to record how many hands each person played and how often they touched the screen.

The results showed that on average, players touched the screen 1,764 times per hour. They also played an average of 11.8 hands per hour.

Interestingly, there was no significant difference in hand or finger usage between men and women. However, younger players were more likely to touch the screen more often than older players.

The findings could have implications for casino design, as they suggest that blackjack tables should be designed so that players can reach all of the cards easily.

Blackjack Macau is a popular casino game that is played using cards numbered from 2 to 10, as well as three face cards: the jack, queen and king. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a "blackjack"), or by reaching a total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

If each hand takes around two minutes to play, then it would take about 960 hands per hour can be played at a blackjack table in Macau.

However, this figure doesn't take into account the time it takes to shuffle the cards and deal them out.

This number drops even further if you factor in waiting times for a seat at a table.
