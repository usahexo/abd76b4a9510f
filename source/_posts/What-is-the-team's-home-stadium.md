#  Which English club do they share a rivalry with?

Liverpool and Manchester United are two of the most successful clubs in English football. They also share a rivalry which has been dubbed as the 'English Derby'. The two clubs are within close proximity of each other, with Liverpool located in Merseyside and Manchester United situated in Greater Manchester.

The rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester United first emerged in the early 1900s. However, it wasn't until the late 1960s that the rivalry began to intensify. This was due to the arrival of George Best at Manchester United and the subsequent success they enjoyed. Liverpool, at the time, were struggling to regain their former glory. The two clubs continued to compete for trophies throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with both teams enjoying periods of success.

The rivalry reached its peak in the 1990s, when they faced each other in several high profile matches. These matches often resulted in violence between fans of both clubs. The climax of this rivalry came in 1996, when Liverpool and Manchester United met in the FA Cup final. Liverpool won the match 3-1, resulting in widespread celebrations amongst Liverpool fans. Since then, the rivalry between these two clubs has slightly diminished, although it is still fiercely contested.
