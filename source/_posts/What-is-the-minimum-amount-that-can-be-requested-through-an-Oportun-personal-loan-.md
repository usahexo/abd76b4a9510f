#  Is it possible to use an Oportun personal loan for business expenses?

An Oportun personal loan can be used for business expenses, but it is important to keep in mind that the company’s eligibility requirements must be met. Oportun is a lending company that offers small personal loans, typically to borrowers who have low credit scores.

The company has been in business since 2006 and has grown rapidly in recent years. It now operates in 22 states across the United States. In order to qualify for an Oportun loan, you must have a valid ID, a checking account, and have lived in the United States for at least two years. You must also make at least $1200 per month and have a credit score of 600 or higher.

If you meet these requirements, you can use an Oportun loan for a variety of purposes, including business expenses. The company offers loans of up to $5000, so it is a good option for small businesses. Loans are repaid over a period of 12 to 36 months and carry an annual percentage rate of 19%.

Oportun is one of the only lenders that offers loans to low-credit borrowers, so it can be a good option for businesses that have been denied credit by other lenders. However, it is important to remember that the interest rates are high and the terms are not as flexible as those offered by traditional lenders.
