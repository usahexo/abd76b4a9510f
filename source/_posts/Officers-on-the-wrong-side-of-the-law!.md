#  Officers on the wrong side of the law!

In light of recent events in which high-ranking police officers have been arrested for a plethora of criminal offenses, it is important to ask the question: are police officers inherently more likely to commit crimes?

Certainly, the recent spate of arrests suggests that there may be a problem. For example, in March 2018, a now-former FBI deputy director was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to investigators. The previous month, a New York City police detective was charged with planting drugs on innocent people. And these are just two examples out of many.

One possible explanation for this trend is the so-called "blue wall of silence." This is the idea that cops protect their own and cover up for each other's misdeeds. This can create a culture in which bad behavior is tolerated and even encouraged.

Another explanation may be that police officers have special access to illegal substances and firearms. This makes it easier for them to commit crimes such as drug trafficking and gun smuggling.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that we need to address the issue of police crime head on. We need to make sure that our officers are held to the highest standards, and that they are held accountable when they break the law.

#  Illegal poker at the Choctaw casino!

The Choctaw Casino Resort in Durant, Oklahoma was raided by police on Sunday night after officials received complaints about an illegal poker game being held at the casino.

According to KTEN News, the Choctaw Police Department seized over $2,000 in cash and several gambling devices from the poker game. No arrests have been made as of yet, but the investigation is ongoing.

This isn't the first time that law enforcement has busted an illegal poker game at the Choctaw Casino Resort. In 2015, police raided a game and arrested four people for participating in illegal gambling.

So if you're looking to sneak in a few hands of poker while you're in Oklahoma, it looks like your best bet is to stay away from the Choctaw Casino Resort!

#  Poker players win big, officers busted!

Two poker players in nearby towns won big this past weekend. One player, a regular at the casino, walked away with almost half a million dollars after playing three nights. The other, a first timer, won nearly $200,000.

In a completely unrelated story, four police officers were arrested for gambling away thousands of dollars in public funds. The department is currently investigating how the officers were able to get their hands on the money in the first place.

#  Officers caught cheating in poker game!

Three police officers have been caught cheating during a card game at a police station in Buenos Aires province, Argentina.

The footage, which was captured on Sunday night, shows the officers using marked cards to gain an advantage over their opponents.

One of the officers can be seen hiding a card up his sleeve, while another bends down to apparently pick up a forgotten card from the floor – only to place it back on the table moments later.

A third officer is also caught trying to change the position of some cards on the table.

The three officers have been suspended while an investigation is carried out into the incident.

#  How could this happen at a casino?!

The casino industry is one that is largely thought to be impenetrable and infallible. After all, with all of the security measures in place, how could anything go wrong? As it turns out, even the most carefully guarded institutions can fall victim to criminal activity. Just last month, a group of criminals managed to rob a casino in Portugal of over $1 million in cash and chips.

This heist was carried out in a particularly brazen way. The criminals simply walked into the casino with firearms and threatened staff and customers before making off with the loot. This incident has raised concerns about the security of casinos and their ability to protect against such brazen acts of robbery.

Clearly, something must be done to tighten up security at casinos around the world. This may require additional training for staff, as well as more sophisticated security measures. It is also important that casinos work more closely with law enforcement agencies to help track down and apprehend criminals who attempt to rob them.

It is unfortunate that such a theft could take place in what is supposed to be a secure environment. However, by taking appropriate steps, casinos can ensure that this type of incident does not happen again.
