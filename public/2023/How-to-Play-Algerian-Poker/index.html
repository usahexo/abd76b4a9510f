      		<h1 id="How-to-Play-Algerian-Poker"><a href="#How-to-Play-Algerian-Poker" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Algerian Poker"></a>How to Play Algerian Poker</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>If you want to try a new type of poker, Algerian poker might be the game for you. This variant is played with a regular deck of 52 cards, and the goal is to make the best five-card hand possible. Here’s how to play:</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h1><p>To begin, each player is dealt two cards face down, and one card face up. The face-up card is called the door card. The player with the highest door card begins the action, and play passes clockwise around the table.</p>
<h1 id="Betting-Rounds"><a href="#Betting-Rounds" class="headerlink" title="Betting Rounds"></a>Betting Rounds</h1><p>On a player’s turn, they can either bet or fold. If they choose to bet, they must put in at least as much as the previous bet (or raise). If they fold, they forfeit their hand and cannot rejoin the hand later.</p>
<p>After all players have had a chance to bet, the dealer flips over the next three cards (the flop). These are communal cards that everyone can use to make their hand. Players now have two more chances to bet - one after the first card on the turn (the fourth card), and one after the second card on the turn (the fifth and final card). Betting rounds continue in this way until all players have either folded or put in the same amount of money. At this point, whoever has the best five-card hand wins!</p>
<h1 id="History-of-Algerian-Poker"><a href="#History-of-Algerian-Poker" class="headerlink" title="History of Algerian Poker"></a>History of Algerian Poker</h1><p>The game of poker is believed to have originated from a 16th century Persian game called as Nas, which was then introduced to France by the soldiers of Napoleon Bonaparte. There are several versions of how poker came to be played in Algeria, but the most popular story is that it was brought over by French colonists in the early 1800s.</p>
<p>Algerian poker is a variation of the traditional French game that is played with a 40-card deck, instead of the standard 52 cards. The game is typically played by four players in two partnerships, with each player receiving five cards. The aim of the game is to score points by making combinations of cards, similar to other card games like bridge or whist.</p>
<p>One point is scored for each Ace, two points for each king, three points for each queen and four points for each jack. The 10, 9 and 8 cards are worth zero points. The player who takes the last trick also scores one point. The first team to reach 10 points wins the game.</p>
<p>There are several variations of Algerian poker, but the most popular version is known as Matwess or “half hearts”. In this version, Aces are worth one point, kings two points, queens three points and jacks four points. The 10, 9 and 8 cards are worth zero points. If a player has no more cards in their hand at the end of a trick, they can still take it and score a point.</p>
<p>Algerian Poker has been enjoyed by people all over the world for centuries and continues to be a favourite choice amongst card players today.</p>
<h1 id="Types-of-Algerian-Poker"><a href="#Types-of-Algerian-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Types of Algerian Poker"></a>Types of Algerian Poker</h1><p>There are different types of Algerian poker that people can play. However, the two most common types of Algerian poker are Belote and Rami.</p>
<p>Belote is a game that is played with 32 cards. The aim of the game is to score points by taking tricks. The player who takes the last trick in the hand also scores points for their team. In order to win, a team must score at least 100 points.</p>
<p>Rami is a game that is played with either 36 or 52 cards. The aim of the game is to score points by taking tricks. The player who takes the last trick in the hand also scores points for their team. In order to win, a team must score at least 200 points.</p>
