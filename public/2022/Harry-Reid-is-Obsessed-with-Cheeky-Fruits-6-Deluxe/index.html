                <h1>Harry Reid is Obsessed with Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Harry-Reid-is-Obsessed-with-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe"><a href="#Harry-Reid-is-Obsessed-with-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe" class="headerlink" title="Harry Reid is Obsessed with Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe"></a>Harry Reid is Obsessed with Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe</h1><p>Senator Harry Reid has a strange obsession with Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe. He can be seen eating them at all hours of the day, and has even been known to take them to bed with him. His staffers have said that he’s been obsessed with the fruit since he first tried them a few years ago.</p>
<p>Reid’s love of Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe is well-known in Washington, and many people have poked fun at him for it. But Reid doesn’t seem to care. He loves those fruits, and he’s not going to stop eating them just because other people think it’s funny.</p>
<p>In fact, Reid has even said that he plans to eat Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe until the day he dies. And judging by how often he eats them, that day may not be too far off.</p>
<h1 id="Harry-Reid-Can’t-Stop-Playing-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe"><a href="#Harry-Reid-Can’t-Stop-Playing-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe" class="headerlink" title="Harry Reid Can’t Stop Playing Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe"></a>Harry Reid Can’t Stop Playing Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe</h1><p>In an embarrassing turn of events, Harry Reid was caught playing Fruit Ninja on his iPad in the Senate Chambers. When asked to explain why he was playing a children’s game, Reid replied “I’m not just playing a children’s game, I’m CHEESING IT UP!”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Reid has been caught playing games on his iPad instead of attending to Senate business. In March of this year, Reid was photographed playing Clash of Clans during a hearing on the budget.</p>
<p>Reid’s colleagues are starting to question his dedication to his job. “These games are a waste of time,” said Republican senator Lindsey Graham. “If Reid wants to play games, he should do it at home where he won’t be distracting us from important work.”</p>
<p>Democrats have come to Reid’s defense, saying that he is simply trying to take a break from the stress of being a senator. “Harry is just trying to have some fun,” said Senator Chuck Schumer. “He works hard and deserves a little down time.”</p>
<p>Regardless of why he is playing them, it is clear that Reid needs to put away his iPads and pay attention to the work at hand. Perhaps he could use this time to learn more about the issues facing our country rather than trying to beat his high score on Fruit Ninja 6 Deluxe.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Senate-Leader-Harry-Reid-is-Addicted-to-Gaming"><a href="#Nevada-Senate-Leader-Harry-Reid-is-Addicted-to-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Senate Leader Harry Reid is Addicted to Gaming"></a>Nevada Senate Leader Harry Reid is Addicted to Gaming</h1><p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, is one of the most powerful people in Washington. But it seems he can’t stay away from the slot machines and blackjack tables.</p>
<p>He has been photographed more than once at casinos in his home state, and even admitted to reporters that he gambles “a little bit.” In an interview with the New York Times, Reid said he goes to the casino “maybe twice a year” and usually loses between $100 and $200 each time.</p>
<p>Reid’s addiction to gambling is hardly a secret - it’s even been joked about by his fellow Senators. But some people are now questioning whether Reid’s habit is appropriate for someone in his position of power.</p>
<p>In a letter to Reid last month, Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California urged him to seek help for his gambling addiction. “As your colleague and friend, I am writing to ask for your help,” Boxer wrote. “I am concerned about reports that you have a gambling addiction.”</p>
<p>She went on to say that she fears Reid’s gambling is harming his ability to do his job, and asked him to enter into treatment. So far there has been no response from Reid.</p>
<p>Reid isn’t the only high-profile politician with a gambling addiction. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has also spoken about his struggles with gambling, and even wrote a book about it.</p>
<p>But while Gingrich was able to overcome his addiction, it’s not clear if Reid can or will do the same. It remains to be seen if this issue will come up during Reid’s re-election campaign next year.</p>
<h1 id="Harry-Reid-Can’t-Get-Enough-of-the-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe-Slot-Machine"><a href="#Harry-Reid-Can’t-Get-Enough-of-the-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe-Slot-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Harry Reid Can’t Get Enough of the Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe Slot Machine"></a>Harry Reid Can’t Get Enough of the Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe Slot Machine</h1><p>Las Vegas - Harry Reid is at it again, pulling the lever on the slot machine and turning his luck around. The 74-year-old Senate Minority Leader has been spotted playing the slots at the Wynn Las Vegas casino this week, and he seems to be particularly fond of the new 6 Deluxe slot machine.</p>
<p>Reid first hit the casino floor on Monday, when he was seen playing a few rounds of blackjack. On Tuesday, however, he was drawn to the new 6 Deluxe machine, which features colorful fruit symbols on its six reels. Reid apparently couldn’t resist giving it a try, and he ended up winning $160 from his initial $20 investment.</p>
<p>“We were pleasantly surprised to see Senator Reid in our casino,” said a spokesperson for Wynn Las Vegas. “He’s always welcome here, and we’re glad that he enjoyed our new slot machine.”</p>
<p>Reid isn’t just a casual gambler; he’s been known to place some high-stakes bets from time to time. In 2006, for example, he won nearly $1 million from a single hand of blackjack at Caesars Palace. But even by Reid’s standards, his winnings this week are relatively modest.</p>
<p>Still, it’s good to see the senator enjoying himself and having some fun away from the political arena. With all the gridlock in Washington these days, it’s nice to see someone lightening up and having a good time.</p>
<h1 id="Harry-Reid-on-Casino-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe-I-Can’t-Stop-Playing"><a href="#Harry-Reid-on-Casino-Cheeky-Fruits-6-Deluxe-I-Can’t-Stop-Playing" class="headerlink" title="Harry Reid on Casino Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe: I Can’t Stop Playing!"></a>Harry Reid on Casino Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe: I Can’t Stop Playing!</h1><p>I have to be honest: I never thought I’d become a big fan of casino games, but when I tried out Harry Reid on Casino Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe the other day, I was hooked! The game is so much fun, and it’s really addictive too.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of different bonuses and mini-games to keep you entertained, and the graphics are really top notch. Even better, the game is available for free on Android and iOS devices, so there’s no excuse not to check it out.</p>
<p>In fact, I’ve been playing it so much that I’m starting to think I might have a bit of a gambling problem… but I can’t stop! If you’re looking for a fun and addictive casino game to keep you entertained for hours on end, then you need to try out Harry Reid on Casino Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe. You won’t regret it!</p>
